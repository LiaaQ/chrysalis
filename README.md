# Chrysalis

**Chrysalis** is a hybrid top-down and platformer game exploring mental health struggles. Players guide characters through daily life and abstract levels representing different conditions.

## Story
A psychological journey through fear, anxiety, and healing.

In Chrysalis, explore a narrative-driven game that blends top-down exploration for representing real life, and 2D platformer to represent the characters' internal worlds. Each one is shaped by a different fear or mental health challenge.

Accompanied by your mysterious companion Ember, you’ll help others — and maybe, in doing so, help yourself. You have your own Chrysalis in you.
